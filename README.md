# BGP cruncher

Research project for analysis of large amounts of BGP data. Start from a rib-dump and apply a generous amount of updates to create a prefix tree, including last-seen and other info. Useful for assessing BGP activity for prefixes. The code is partially based on work by Johann Schlamp and Christian Eckert.

The code may look a bit horrible, suggestions and improvements are welcome, but the project is not actively maintained. 

Happy hacking d^.^b
